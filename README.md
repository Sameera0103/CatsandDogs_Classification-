## Overview

Cats and dogs classification is a common image classification task where the goal is to distinguish between images containing cats and images containing dogs. This task is often approached using machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset typically consists of labeled images of cats and dogs, and the model is trained to learn features that differentiate between the two classes. Once trained, the model can classify new images as either cats or dogs with a certain level of accuracy. This task has numerous applications, including pet monitoring systems, animal behavior analysis, and content filtering in social media.

## Dependencies

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x: You can download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Python Libraries


- NumPy: For numerical operations.
-TensorFlow:For standard mathematical operations or tensors.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the code and obtain  Titanic Survival Prediction
1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sameera0103/CatsandDogs_Classification.git  
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd  Cats and dogs Classification
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the required Python libraries as mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.

4. **Data Preparation:**

   We loaded  Cats and dogs Classification dataset from keras and preprocessed them.

5. **Configure Parameters:**

   Open the `config.py` file and set the required parameters, such as  Titanic Survival Prediction,number of death,number of injured.

6. **Run the Code:**

   Execute the main script to analyze Generative Model for  Titanic Survival Prediction.

   ```bash
   python  Cats and dogs Classification.py
   ```

   The script will perform data preprocessing,visulisation and classification.
7. **View Results:**

   The results and visualizations will be saved in the `output` folder. You can explore them to gain insights into  Cats and dogs Classification.
## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the code by modifying the parameters in the `config.py` file. Some of the key configurations include:

- `DATA_FILE`: Path to the input transaction data file.
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: Path to the output directory where results will be saved.
- Other parameters related to visualization and data preprocessing.

## Results

The code will generate various insights and visualizations, including:

-Give confusion matrix with accuracy.
- Heat maps 

This project is based on the principles of data preprocessing,visualisation and classification of spam and ham. The code uses open-source libraries and is intended for educational and practical use.
